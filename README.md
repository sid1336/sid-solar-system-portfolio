# 🌞 Sid's Solar System Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive **solar system-themed portfolio**!  
Every planet, moon, and orbit in this virtual cosmos opens a portal to my education, experience, research, skills, and projects.  
Explore my universe of computational physics, AI, photonics, and much more—presented with glowing effects, pop-up modals, and cosmic style.
